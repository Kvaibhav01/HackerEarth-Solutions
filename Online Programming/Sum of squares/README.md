# SUM OF SQUARES OF ARRAY OF SIZE N

## Problem Description:

Write a program that takes N integer values as input from the user, and calculates and displays the sum of squares of each element in the array.

Example: If the array contains 2, 4, 6 and 8, the output should be 120. (i.e. (2x2) + (4x4) + (6x6) + (8x8))

## Following steps are followed:

- First, we take the size of the array as input (N).

- Then, the array is declared to be of integer type.

- The space separated array elements are taken as input from user.

- An integer type variable called *sum* is declared and initialised with value 0 as no array element is added yet.

- Now, a for loop is used to read each element starting from index 0 to N-1 and are simultaneously added to previous value of sum and array element present at that particular loop index is added two times.

- Lastly, the variable sum which contains the final answer is printed as the output.
