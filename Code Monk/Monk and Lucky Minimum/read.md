# Input:
- First line consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- First line of each test case consists of a single integer N denoting the size of array A.
- Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.

# Output:
- For each test case, print "Lucky" (without quotes) if frequency of minimum element is odd, otherwise print
- "Unlucky"(without quotes). Print a new line after each test case.
